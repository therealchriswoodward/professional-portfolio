            <h3><u>Python For Financial Analysis</u></h3>
            <p>
                My favorite utilities for Python are financial and data analysis. Python makes
                these subjects easy in my opinion. I find that yfinance is valuable if you are
                seeking to analyze a stock's returns as well as build a portfolio. There are certain
                principles of corporate finance, such as portfolio standard deviation, that you can
                write code to do in seconds rather than hours or even days depending on how difficult
                it is to gather data.
            </p>
            <p>
                With Python and yfinance, you can gather and resample the data of a stock and make
                calcualtions in just a few seconds after you have written the code. Below is an example
                of such a program. I wrote this to pull data from just one stock, calculate the average
                return of the stock year over year, calculate the standard deviation of those returns,
                and then calculate the return on risk.

                I imported two libraries: yFinance and NumPy. yFinance allows us to use built-in functions to
                gather data from Yahoo Finance for analysis. I have found NumPy to be excellent for doing the
                kinds of mathematical calculations that come with doing this sort of thing.
            </p>
            <p>
                I declared a variable to hold the ticker "AAPL" and used in the yf.download( ) function
                to get the historical data for AAPL. I retrieved the daily data over the previous ten-year
                period. On the next line, I sampled the data for the daily closing prices. Finally, I resampled
                the data so that I would have the year over year percent change.
            </p>
            <p>
                After printing these returns, I added a line of asterisks for readability in the terminal
                and began my calculations with NumPy. I calculated the average return of the stock using the
                np.nanmean( ) function because when you retrieve the returns the way I have, the first year will
                return "NaN". The nanmean( ) function disregards that value. I also used the np.std( ) function
                to find the standard deviation of the returns to assess how far the stocks returns deviate from
                their average.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the final bits of code, I printed my results formated for readability, and divided the average
                return by the standard deviation of annual returns to find the return on risk. Below is what is
                prints to the terminal. Of course, it will change over time depending on when you perform this
                analysis.
