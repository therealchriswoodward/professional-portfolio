                <em>
                    "I don't believe in cookie cutter leadership. Spending time staring at a cell phone trying to learn <br>
                    how teenage girls and cute party boys would run the company is not a winning strategy. Business leadership <br>
                    today requires technological skills, complex problem-solving skills, people skills, and just as important: <br>
                    a personality and the ability to get employees to enjoy their time at work and actually want <br>
                    to be there. An MBA and a smartphone just won't cut it in today's market.<br>It's time to make a paradigm shift."
