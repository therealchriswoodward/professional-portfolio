        <h3>Our True Nature</h3>
        <p>
            Who are you trying to be? Do you know who you really are? Are the answers to those
            two questions the same? This is a battle that a surprisingly high number of people
            fight. We have very strong-willed extroverted people trying to do quiet little jobs
            sitting at a desk with no talking and no interaction, and it doesn't last. Conversely,
            we also have very quiet introverted people trying to be the go-getter salesman with
            all the energy and personality. The truth is: they can do this, but it won't last.
            Both of these types of people will always go back to being who they are.
        </p>
        <p>
            Imagine the shy guy going up on a stage and trying to be a rockstar. Can he do it?
            He can absolutely do it;  however, it is only a matter of time before he shuts back
            down. Now, imagine a loud natural-born leader who can't stop and won't stop doing
            secretary work. Can they do it? Yes they can. Will it last? Not in a million years.
            It is only a matter of time before the powerful personality of the assertive type
            finally comes out. It is only a matter of time for the timid personality of the
            would-be rockstar finally shows itself, and all that energy disappears.
        </p>
        <p>
            We live in a world filled with people who would be phenomenal school teachers
            (which we desperately need), but they're tied up being an average real estate
            agent. We have people who are trying as hard as they can to be an entrepreneur
            when they would be a world-class artist if they would just go that direction
            and put the time in there to achieve success. The inevitable future of these
            people is they will end up doing their current jobs the way their nature leads
            them to do it. I once heard it explained that when trouble comes an artist will
            always focus on the product; the manager will focus on the people; the entrepreneur
            will sell the business and move on.
        </p>

            The success lies in our God-given abilities. People could be making far more money
            doing what they are born to do than they ever will chasing a career that they think
            can make them a billionaire or whatever is the trendy new occupation to have. (Right
            now, as I'm writing this, it's owning a hedge fund. There's a job that is definitely
            not for everyone!)

            Spend some time thinking and writing down your natural strengths and weaknesses. Create
            scenarios in your mind. "If this goes wrong, what would I do?" Analyze your answers.
            You may be very surprised at how your solutions would line up <em>perfectly</em> with
            some career paths!
