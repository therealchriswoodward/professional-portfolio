        <h2>New Year Brings New Opportunities</h2>
        <p>
            It is the time of year when many of us have made decisions that we are turning over a new leaf;
            we're finally ready to make some changes. We are ready to get motivated, to get in shape, to
            increase our income, to raise our standards and the quality of our lives. I believe every single
            day is another blessing because it is another opportunity to do all of the same things.
        </p>
        <p>
            As we move forward into new routines and new habits, we will quickly realize that many of them
            cause us a great deal of discomfort. It isn't easy to go to the gym and hit the weights and run
            on the treadmill until we're tired. It isn't easy to sit and read every single day if you hardly
            ever read to begin with with. Reframing these feelings and experiences can unlock a part of us
            that we never knew existed! When we feel that soreness from lifting weights, it is an indicator
            that we are growing! When we notice that we aren't such a great reader in our lack of practice,
            it is an indicator that we can sharpen our minds beyond our current level of comprehension! It's
            a beautiful thing.
        </p>
        <p>
            How we view discomfort and pain has a lot to do with why most people only make it a week or two
            into the year before they have given up on their goal and went right back to the same old things
            they always do. When we think of works like "pain" and "uncomfortable", we have negative
            associations for those words. We usually don't associate "pain" and "growth" or "struggling"
            and "getting smarter". These associations are what drive our beliefs about what we are doing when
            we experience these feelings. When we think of pain, we think it's hurting us rather than making
            us grow and if we continue to think this way about working out, we won't last very long; it doesn't
            matter how much willpower we have. If we continue to think of learning as struggling, it's only
            a matter of time before we stop trying to learn.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2024, let's make the effort not just for the better habits of getting up earlier and eating better,
            but also for more empowering language and a higher level of thinking!
