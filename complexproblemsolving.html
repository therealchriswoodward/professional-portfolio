        <h3>Complex Problem-Solving</h3>
        <p>
            There are many times that we encounted highly complex scenarios with multiple outcomes, and we're faced with a
            decision to make. As humans, we often struggle with being able to work with too many things at once. If you ask
            the average person to pick thier favorite from a list of three items, they can usually do it; make it a list of
            ten and it becomes much more difficult. There are ways to learn whether or not you are making a good decision
            based on the outcomes you can see, and that is an expected value calculation. All you need to know are the
            probabilities of each outcome, the rewards of the positive outcomes, and the penalties of the negative outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's say you have a decision to make and there are three positive outcomes and two negative ones. For ease sake,
            we will imagine they all have the same likelihood; there's a 20% chance of each of them. Outcome 1 would give us
            $1,000. Outcome 2 would give us $400. Outcome 3 would give us $100. Outcome 4 would mean we lose $1,000. Outcome
            5 would mean we lose $350. Is this is a good bet? You multiply each outcome by its respective probability, and
            then you find the sum of the weight positive outcomes as well as the sum of the weighted negative outcomes, and
            you subtract the sum of the negative outcomes from the sum of the positive outcomes. If the result is a positive
            number, it could be a good bet!
        </p>
        <p>
            That math would look like this:<br>
            (($1,000 * 0.20) + ($400 * 0.20) * ($100 * 0.20)) - (($1,000 * 0.20) + ($350 * 0.20))
        </p>
        <p>
            That simplifies to:<br>
            $300 - $270 = +$30
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a far superior way to make decisions. Taking the emotional overwhelm out of
            the situation and taking a hard data-driven and systematic approach lightens the mental
            load and can give clarity, leading to lower levels of stress and better outcomes overall.
