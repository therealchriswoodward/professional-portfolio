            <h3><u>Cost Volume Profit Analysis: Single Product</u></h3>
            <p>
                Let's explore a concept in managerial accounting called "Cost Volume Profit Analysis". 
                The idea is to figure out how much of our revenue goes toward paying our fixed costs.
                The faster we break even, the faster we become profitable. There are many times that small 
                business owners especially tend to focus on "paying the bills" rather than being profitable.
                This leads us to believe that if we pay the bills, we broke even. This is not necessarily the case.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's take analyze a single product. We will imagine that our variable costs on this product are 
                $5.00, and we are selling it for $12.95. Our fixed costs in this scenario will be $400.00. Now, we pose the question:
                <br><em>How many units must we sell to break even?</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                First, we must understand that as we sell more units, our variable cost will rise. When we sell one unit, our variable cost is
                $5.00. When we sell two units, our variable cost is $10.00, and so on. It is a common mistake to assume that if we cross teh threshold
                of our fixed costs at $400, that we have broken even; however, this does not take into account our variable cost on the item. We must 
                calculate our total cost as well as our contribution margin to find out how many items we must sell to break even. Assuming there are no 
                special sales, discounts, or other circumstances, this is mostly a linear problem.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below is a chart showing how this works:
            </p>

            </figure>
            <p>
                As you can see, we pass the point of covering fixed costs at about thirty-one units sold; however, we do not break even until we sell
                about fifty-one units. This is an effective way to make projections and begin building a pricing strategy as well as evaluate the reality
                of the business. If it is a micro-business, one must pose the question: <em>Can I realistically surpass this many sales of this unit every
                month and spend the my time generating profits rather than merely covering costs?</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                If it doesn't make sense to stock, list, and sell the product, we can skip it and preserve capital for something more promising. Opportunity
                cost is always a factor to consider before taking on any endeavor, no matter how small.

            <h3><u>Cost Volume Profit Analysis: Multiple Products</u></h3>
            <p>
                We can use the same type of analysis to analyze our contribution margin on each individual product as well as our total contribution margin.
                This is an effective way to see if we are profitable overall. I added a screenshot below of some analysis I did on a family-member's micro-business recently. Out of respect to their privacy I
                changed the names of the products to more vague names for this. I put the following spreadsheet together in Excel. I didn't make it fancy; 
                I focused on getting the job done and knowing what I was looking at.
            </p>
            <figure style="text-align: center; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
                <figcaption style="text-align: left;"><u><em><b>Figure 1.2:</b> CVPA for multiple products</em></u></figcaption>
                <img class="cvpa-multipleproducts-image" style="width: 100%;" src="C:\Users\there\Desktop\For Repository\images\cvfa_multiple products.png" alt="Cost Volume Profit Analysis Example with Multiple Products">
            </figure>
            <p>
                As you can see above, we can figure out our overall contribution across all of our products. This metric will fluctuate based on how many units of each product we sell. Using a spreadsheet to do
                this sort of analysis allows us to increment the number of units sold for each product and optimize our sales. We can find out which product should recieve the most resources as far as marketing
                and advertising go. Incrementing each product from zero to infinite would take lifetimes, so this is a great place for a script to do some optimization based on a range we believe we can realistically
                be in as far as sales for each unit. That kind of estimation would based on historical data or the characteristics of the business such as how big the business is or how much capital is available.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another valuable observation that can be taken into consideration is that if we zero out the number of units sold for Item C and remove it from the inventory altogether, we find that the overall
                contribution margin goes up. This has to do with the significantly higher variable cost associated with Item C. Additionally, we notice that the total percentage of revenue gained from Items A
                and B go up significantly.
            </p>
            <figure style="text-align: center;">
                <figcaption style="text-align: left;"><u><em><b>Figure 1.3:</b> CVPA minus Item C</em></u></figcaption>
                <img class="cvpa-multipleproducts-minusitemC-image" src="C:\Users\there\Desktop\For Repository\images\cvfa_multiple products minus item C.png" alt="Cost Volume Profit Analysis Example Taking Away One Product">
            </figure>
            <p>
                This presents more opportunity for pricing strategy and, as I mentioned in the example with only one product, we have the opportunity cost analysis of whether or not we are better off not having the
                product at all. While Item C makes the most profits, it also brings with it the highest variable cost. If demand for that product
                isn't remarkably higher to justify the nearly four times variable cost, we may gather that it is best to just not carry that product.
            </p>
            <p>
                To close on this example; if you are wondering why I had "Price 1" and "Price 2" in their own cells for each of the products with the exception of
                Item C, it is because this particular business had a margin requirement of 50%. If they can't make 50% margin, they won't carry the product. When I
                asked about their prices to analyze where they were currently at with their pricing strategy, I found that they were in the 60% range. I explained to
                them that this is a situation where we can borrow a term from investing language; we have a "margin of safety" of about 10% on Items A and B. They can use
                this to strategize on discounts or sales where the price can be lowered on special occasions to drive more sales on those products. As long as the
                margin is above 50%, they are still meeting their goal. This gives them peace of mind and a certain degree of freedom as to how much they can do to
                increase revenue and attract new customers. Pretty neat, huh?
