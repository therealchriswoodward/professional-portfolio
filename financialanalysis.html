                Let's explore a concept in managerial accounting called "Cost Volume Profit Analysis". 
                The idea is to figure out how much of our revenue goes toward paying our fixed costs.
                The faster we break even, the faster we become profitable. There are many times that small 
                business owners especially tend to focus on "paying the bills" rather than being profitable.
                This leads us to believe that if we pay the bills, we broke even. This is not necessarily the case.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's take analyze a single product. We will imagine that our variable costs on this product are 
                $5.00, and we are selling it for $12.95. Our fixed costs in this scenario will be $400.00. Now, we pose the question:
                <br><em>How many units must we sell to break even?</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                First, we must understand that as we sell more units, our variable cost will rise. When we sell one unit, our variable cost is
                $5.00. When we sell two units, our variable cost is $10.00, and so on. It is a common mistake to assume that if we cross teh threshold
                of our fixed costs at $400, that we have broken even; however, this does not take into account our variable cost on the item. We must 
                calculate our total cost as well as our contribution margin to find out how many items we must sell to break even. Assuming there are no 
                special sales, discounts, or other circumstances, this is mostly a linear problem.
