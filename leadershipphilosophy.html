            <h3><u>Leadership Philosophy</u></h3>
            <p>
                Leadership in business has changed over the years. Today, employees and team members want to feel there is
                a reason for their job. I personally believe they are correct to be this way. It is the leader's job to
                remind everyone of their purpose and empower them to be the best they can be. It is invaluable to any
                company to spend time with employees providing guidance and mentorship helping them plan their futures
                and make strategic investments in themselves within the company. An employee with ambition and a dream
                as well as the foresight that they can use their current position to get their (which is always true) is
                an asset to the company. This is far more valuable than disengaged employees who barely know (or don't
                like) their leader. They have to feel heard, appreciated, and respected. If they are a "teammember" they
                should feel like there actually <em>is</em> a team and that leadership is part of it.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you don't have this fellowship, or when you don't have an environment where a teammember feels
                they can learn from leadership, it is only a matter of time before one of them gets a promotion to a management
                position and an alliance is formed. It is the same idea as a populist politician. Someone of influence gets a
                group of employees behind them, and as long as their followers support everything they do and say, they are
                enabled, disengaged, and can even do damage to the company. It happens in fast food and real estate brokerages
                all the time. Once that person gets into that position, you have a gatekeeper who doesn't allow employees below
                them who actually want to contribute and grow within the company to do so. Now you are losing your best employees.
                This simply cannot be allowed to happen. The only hedge against this is to be available to your team for councel
                as much as possible. Even if you have assigned someone to them, they should always know they are welcome to come
                straight to you; and the person you assigned to them should always know the teammembers can do this. You can handle
                poor lower management effectively by giving employees the ability to walk past the gatekeeper straight to their boss.
                When bad lower management knows this, the bad behavior is abstained from more often than the average.

                The United States of America became the greatest country of all time by empowering the people. It's an excellent
                business model. When people aren't pinned down and opportunities are not kept from them either by intention or neglect
                they can become remarkable people. It is hard to compete with a team of remarkable people.
